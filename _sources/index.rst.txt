.. sidebar:: Predator Free 2050
    :subtitle: Rid New Zealand of introduced predators by the year 2050
    
    An ambitious goal to rid New Zealand of the most damaging introduced predators that threaten our nationâ€™s natural taonga, our economy and primary sector.

    Ridding New Zealand of possums, rats and stoats by 2050 is a New Zealand-wide goal. It will require new techniques and a co-ordinated team effort across communities, iwi, and the public and private sectors.
