Overview
========

The complete solution is based on the framework provided by `MySensors.org <http://mysensors.org>`_ which is an Arduino library with support for NRF24L01+ wireless transceivers. Because the library takes care of all the complicated set up needed to get the radios up and running, you can focus on assembling your sensors and making use of the data.

The project has several components that produce the complete solution. There is core infrastructure that needs to be in place such as a Gateway and `MQTT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT>`_ service, some of these you may already have if you have been building other sensor projects. From there you can add as many trap sensor nodes as you need.

Optional components are `Node-Red <https://nodered.org/>`_ which will let you integrate your trap sensors with external services such as `Trap NZ <http://api.trap.nz>`_ . I used `MyController <http://mycontroller.org>`_ as a local GUI interface to see what my sensors were up to. You could conceivably use something else like `Domoticz <http://www.domoticz.com/>`_ as long as it can subscribe to messages that the sensor publishes to MQTT.

Core Infrastructure
-------------------

* MySensors wifi gateway to bridge from the NRF24L01+ wireless sensor node network to Ethernet
  
  * Low power “always on” power supply.
  * ESP8266 / NodeMCU
  * NRF24L01+ / RFM69 transceiver 

* MQTT service to act as a communications bus.

  * I used Mosquitto running on a Raspberry Pi, but you could always use one you might already have running for other projects or even try a publicly accessible online MQTT service.

Wireless Sensor Nodes
---------------------

* Battery powered wireless Sensor Node

  * 3.7v Li-Ion battery to supply power to;
  * Arduino Nano type MCU
  * Magnetic reed switch or some kind of switch contraption that can be somehow actuated by a mechanical pest trap.
  * NRF24L01+ / RFM69 wireless transceiver.

Optional bits
-------------

* MyController or Domoticz for local monitoring.

   * This does nothing but give you a view of the sensor nodes by subscribing to messages on the MQTT bus. You might want to send yourself alerts when a trap is sprung and you could use these to trigger alerts via push notification or email. (Keep in mind some target pests are more active at night!)

* Node-Red to bridge from the MQTT bus to other external services such as http://trap.nz
