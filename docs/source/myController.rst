MyController
============

Yeah, I haven't written this bit yet. This is the program you can use on your local network to monitor the gateway and sensor nodes. You can write rules to fire you messages when a trap is sprung and all that good stuff. You don't have to use MyController but its quick and easy to set up if you don't already use something else.
