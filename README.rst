AntiPesto
============

AntiPesto is a DIY IoT project for a backyard trapper to wirelessly monitor their own pest traps over a short distance.

In an homage to the home inventor, the project title is inspired by the name of Wallace and Grommit's pest control business "Anti-Pesto" from the 2005 film `Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit <https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312004>`_.

To build this project yourself you should be familiar working with Arduino projects, some soldering is needed and a bit of creativity.
